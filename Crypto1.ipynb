Unprintable binary data do not pose a problem if all we do is store this data into a binary file.  On the other hand, it is **not ok** if we want to send the ciphertext containing unprintable characters in an email or if we want to view the data printed as output from a program.  How do we make our data **readable**.\n",

        "Let's take a look at how the encoding works.  The basic idea is to divide the data into chunks of three 8-bit bytes (24 bits).    Each 24-bit chunk is then sub-divided into four 6-bit chunks (still 24 bits).  These 6-bit chunks give us a number from 0 to 63 which we use to map into a table of ASCII characters as shown below.\n",
